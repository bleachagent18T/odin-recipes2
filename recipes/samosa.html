    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>A samosa (/səˈmoʊsə/) (listenⓘ) (Hindi: समोसा) ( Persian: سمبوسه) is a fried South Asian[2] and West Asian snack. It is a pastry with a savory filling that mostly consists of vegetables like spiced potatoes, onions, and peas, but can also include meat or fish, or even cheese. Its name originates from the Persian word sambosag (سنبوسگ) (meaning 'triangular pastry'). It is made in different shapes, including triangular, cone, or crescent, depending on the region.[3][4][5] Samosas are often accompanied by chutney, and have origins in medieval times or earlier.</p>
